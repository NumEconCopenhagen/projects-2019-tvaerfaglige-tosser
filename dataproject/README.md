# Dataproject

Welcome to our project! All code is contained in the iPython Notebook, constructed to be opened in a Jupyter Notebook. By running the code-boxes one by one, and following the instructions in the text-boxes, you will be able to reproduce results.

Furthermore, the notebook offers an option to include a stock of your choice to the analysis. We highly encourage that you try this.

Enjoy!

NB: Data is fetched from AlphaVantage, who restricts URL-calls to five per minute. As long as you just run our code as supposed, this should not constitute a problem, but you might run into issues, if you alter with the code.
