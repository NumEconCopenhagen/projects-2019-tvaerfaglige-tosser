# Modelproject

Welcome to our project! It focusses on Cournot duopoly with (variable) substitution between goods and opportunities for collution. The project is based on the work of Jan Boone, but is extended to include fixed costs as well as a number of features throughout the model.

Among other, we find optimal production quantity for any firm in Cournot duopol and we examine and find a negative relationship between breakdown point of collusion to time discount factor.

Enjoy!
